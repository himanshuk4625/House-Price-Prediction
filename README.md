KC House Price Prediction Model
This repository contains the code for the KC House Price Prediction Model, which predicts the prices of houses in King County, Washington, using machine learning algorithms.

Overview
The model was built using the King County Housing dataset, which contains information on over 21,000 houses sold between 2014 and 2015. The model uses various features, such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and square footage, to predict the prices of houses in King County.
